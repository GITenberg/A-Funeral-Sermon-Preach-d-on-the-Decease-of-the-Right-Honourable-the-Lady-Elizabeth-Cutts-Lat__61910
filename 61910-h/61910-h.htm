<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Numb. xxiii. <i>v.</i>
10. latter part.</p>
<p><i>Let me die the death of the Righteous</i>, <i>and let my
latter end be like his</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Lord&rsquo;s Day being one of
the Sundays in <i>Advent</i>, wherein, by Order of the Church, we
are put in mind of Christ&rsquo;s second coming to Judgment: And
it being also a day on which we are to partake of the Holy
Sacrament, shewing forth Christ&rsquo;s Death till He come again;
it might not be unseasonable on it to meditate also on our latter
ends, if so be we had not this special Mournful occasion from the
Death of the Honourable, the Vertuous, and the Religious Lady
<i>Cutts</i>.</p>
<p>There is not indeed before your Eyes one part of the outward
doleful appearance usual at such Solemn Services: To the
Monuments of her <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>Lord&rsquo;s Ancestors, to the place of their Burial, are
removed the last earthly remains of that Excellent Person.&nbsp;
But tho that spectacle of Mortality that object of True Sorrow,
be not here present; the want of it, in order to create
attention, or the want of Expressions suitable to her Worth, will
(it is hoped) be supplied by your Remembrance, or rather View (as
it were) of her so late presence in this Congregation: And by
your knowledge of her Religious Deportment, her Exemplary
Devotion, and Holy Life, truly imitable by any who prepare for a
better World.&nbsp; And therefore, as none, who have the hope of
Christians, but may wish they may pass their appointed Time in
the same regular, modest, and pious Manner: So, tho Her days were
few (in regard of what might have been expected, and was by all
who knew Her, earnestly pray&rsquo;d for) yet no Christians but
may wish that they may <i>die the death of the Righteous</i>, and
that their <i>latter end</i>, tho so sudden, <i>may be like
Hers</i>.</p>
<p>Therefore, since these Discourses are intended for the
Edification of the Living, and not for comfort, or any advantage
to the Deceased, vouchsafe seriously to consider, how just an
Occasion, and how lively an Admonition all here have, in this
deplorable instance of the frailty of all Humane Satisfactions,
to mind their own <i>latter end</i>, and to Pray, and provide
that, at any <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>warning, or without any, they may be ready to obey
God&rsquo;s summons, and depart hence.</p>
<p>For, Who is there in this Assembly, of what Condition, or Age
soever, that, not Weeks since, might have expected survivance to
this Honourable Person: To whom, as none but would have wisht, so
none but would have been ready to promise, very many, and very
happy days.&nbsp; But, (so vain and brittle are all our
confidences!) Behold!&nbsp; How soon is all the expectation of
Honourable Families defeated?&nbsp; How soon by a sudden stroke,
is Health chang&rsquo;d into Sickness, Sickness into Death, and
the hopes and joy for an Heir, into a double Funeral?&nbsp; How
little have availed the respects of Friends, the Honours and
Titles of the Great, the Skill of the Learned, and the most
unfeigned Prayers of the nearest, and most dear Relations?&nbsp;
In the midst of all the contents of a High and Noble Condition,
the near Promises of Posterity, the Vigour of Youth, with the
Lustre of Beauty, and the esteem of all that honour&rsquo;d such
Vertue, Goodness and Piety.&nbsp; How without any warning by an
immediate command, <i>dust is return&rsquo;d to dust</i>, <i>and
the Spirit return&rsquo;d to God who gave it</i>.&nbsp; Since
then we are all made of the same Clay, and know not how near our
appointed change may be, may we all prepare to give an account
for what we have done in the Flesh.&nbsp; What is it then that
will <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>afford
us True Consolation, while we look on the frail estate of our
Bodies, or the guilt of our Souls?&nbsp; What will support us
when we behold the Pit which may soon gape for us? and when our
selves shall stand on the brink of Eternity?&nbsp; What is it
will enable us to endure the thoughts of having our Bones
crumbl&rsquo;d to dust, and of our Souls appearing before the
Judgment Seat of the Great, the Living God?</p>
<p>We see how far all that is valued in this World, can go, The
Wealth, the Pomp, the splendor of Attendance, the kind offices of
Friends, and the Tears of dearest Relations, accompany what is
Mortal but to the mouth of the Grave; and then, the Body once so
cherisht, adorn&rsquo;d, and honour&rsquo;d is committed to the
Earth, to silence and putrefaction.&nbsp; But yet, (blessed be
God,) by whose just sentence all this comes to pass, there have
been in other Ages, and are in this, very many Christians, who
sensible of the weakness of their Bodies, and the stain of their
Natures, of the terrors of Death, and the greater terrors of
Judgment after Death; have yet not only with Patience waited for
it; but thro Faith in the Blessed Jesus, have earnestly
long&rsquo;d for their dissolution.</p>
<p>Since then we cannot be so vain as to hope to live here for
ever, since we know, that as Generations have past: so this
Generation shall pass <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>away: Of all them who have gone before
us, whom would we chuse to be with? with whole Souls, of all such
whom we have read of, or heard, or knew, would we venture to be
in an Eternal State?&nbsp; We know that all the Sons of Men, or
all that profess the Christian Faith, have not liv&rsquo;d after
the same manner: As their Faces, their Statures and Conditions
have differ&rsquo;d; so have their deeds been more unlike.&nbsp;
There have been such as have been, and are yet, Children of
disobedience, have liv&rsquo;d without God in the World, as if
they were sure to die as the Beasts: and there have been such,
who perswaded that their Souls were Immortal, and that their
Bodies shall be raised again, have serv&rsquo;d and lov&rsquo;d
and prais&rsquo;d God, and persever&rsquo;d faithful unto
Death.</p>
<p>Into these two sorts all the sons of Men are divided.&nbsp;
Here they are not always to be distinguisht by us, by what they
act, or by what they enjoy: But wondrous will the difference be
of their future conditions.&nbsp; To all who are living, and hear
the Word of Truth, God gives their choice which of these two
sorts of Men they will follow, and hereafter be with them for
ever.&nbsp; Which of these do we seriously think it wisdom to be
in the number of? whose Lot would we covet? would we be with
them, who have minded only temporal and sensual things: or would
we, as this godly, deceased Person, mind <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>above all
things a future Eternal Concern: And wish each of us: <i>Let me
die the death of the Righteous</i>, <i>and let my latter end be
like his</i>.</p>
<p>These are the words of <i>Balaam</i>, a Prophet, hired by
<i>Balak</i> King of <i>Moab</i>, and brought up into the high
places of <i>Baal</i>, that from thence he might curse the People
of <i>Israel</i>.&nbsp; But God put different words into his
mouth; and by him pronounceth a Blessing on them: He foresees and
foretels, <i>v.</i> 9.&nbsp; That <i>Israel shall not dwell
alone</i>, <i>nor be reckoned among the Nations</i>: That he
shall increase in this World, as the Sand of the Sea, or the
Stars in Heaven, <i>v.</i> 10.&nbsp; <i>Who can count the dust
of</i> Jacob, <i>and the number of the fourth part of</i>
Israel?&nbsp; But, However he is amazed at the prosperity of
God&rsquo;s chosen People; however he admires their multitudes,
or their strength, beyond all that, he sees somewhat that is far
more desireable; and wishes for himself a different Blessing, and
such as is beyond all earthly advantages: He prays not so much
for the Life, as the Death of a True <i>Israelite</i>: That is,
not only the easie and timely departure in a good old Age, which
God promised to the Sons of <i>Jacob</i>, if they kept his
Commandments; but in a more mystical sence (as some even ancient
<i>Jewish</i> Interpreters explain it) <i>Let me be as the
Righteous</i>, <i>and where they are after Life</i>: An Heir of
Paradise, <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>and with them who shall not see the face of Hell.</p>
<p>A very wise wish; if that had been enough to make
<i>Balaam</i> happy: But he loving the wages of Unrighteousness,
forsook the right way, and fell by the Sword of the
<i>Israelites</i>, <i>Numb.</i> 31. 8.&nbsp; And may we not infer
from S. <i>Peter&rsquo;s</i> warning us, not to follow his way,
That he died not the death of the Righteous.</p>
<p>The dumb beast rebuked the Prophet: And the Prophet, who
possibly receiv&rsquo;d no benefit from his inspired knowledge,
may yet by this wish, instruct us: we may therefore inquire why
we may desire <i>to die the death of the Righteous</i>, <i>and to
have our latter end like his</i>.</p>
<p>For death it self is far from being desirable: And tho the
rich will, with the Son of <i>Sirach</i>, cry out: <i>O
death</i>, <i>how bitter is the remembrance of thee</i>, <i>to a
man that liveth at ease</i>, <i>and rest in his possessions</i>;
<i>to a man that hath nothing to vex him</i>?&nbsp; Yet even the
Poor and the distressed, and the most Valiant cannot, without
some trembling in secret, view it approaching; even Christ
himself cryed out, <i>O my father</i>, <i>if it be possible</i>,
<i>let this Cup pass form me</i>.</p>
<p>This dread is implanted in us (among other reasons) That we
who groan under many Evils and Miseries, (which make Life often
burdensom) may indure to live, till we are ordered to depart, by
him, to whom alone belong the issues of Life <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>and
Death.&nbsp; Accordingly, He who made, hath past sentence on
us.&nbsp; <i>It is appointed for all men to die</i>: No one hath
been able to save himself, or those whom he love; tho he may have
liv&rsquo;d many years he shall see the Grave, and be
gather&rsquo;d to his Fathers.&nbsp; And yet tho this be most
certainly known, together with the uncertainty of the Last Hour:
yet few but are surpriz&rsquo;d by it: and if it give long
warning, it is fuller of Terror, the pains, and the ruins of the
Body, with the decay of the Faculties of the Mind, together with
the Agonies that are long strugled with, are more terrible than
Death it self.&nbsp; And when the last moment is past, how
amazing is the change? those Persons who were so much courted, or
dreaded, how must they say to <i>Corruption</i>, <i>thou art my
Father</i>, <i>and to the Worm</i>, <i>thou art my Sister and
Mother</i>, <i>when they go down to the bars of the pit</i>,
<i>when they rest together in the Grave</i>?&nbsp; For our days
are appointed, beyond which we shall not go.&nbsp; The Light, and
whatever is joyous in it, must be forsaken.&nbsp; Of all our
Furniture we shall take with us but a Shrowd; in all the World
only for a while we shall have a few feet of ground: Our Memory
be forgotten, and our Place know us no more.&nbsp; The Righteous
have no privilege or exemption.&nbsp; Original Sin hath tainted
all Constitutions: To it the best of Men have added their own
Offences to make them more Mortal: <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>Their days are few, and evil: and they
go to the house appointed for all the Living.&nbsp; For,
<i>Abraham</i> is dead, tho stiled the Righteous Man by God
himself: and the Prophets where are they?&nbsp; They are long
since fallen asleep: nay, the Son of God himself gave up the
Ghost: <i>He humbled himself to death</i>, <i>even the death of
the Cross</i>.&nbsp; All his Disciples have <i>drunk of the same
Cup</i>: even the most beloved one, the Evangelist who lay in his
bosom, before his Lords coming, saw Death.&nbsp; And they of whom
the World was not worthy, were afflicted, tormented, slain with
the Sword.</p>
<p>Since then the Righteous die as the Wicked: since their days
are few, and often fewer: since they even now suffer for
righteousness sake: and are, many of them, in the eye of the
World, most miserable: since the same event happens <i>to him
that sacrificeth</i>, <i>and to him that sacrificeth not</i>, why
should we desire <i>to die the death of the Righteous</i>, <i>and
have our latter end like his</i>?</p>
<p>The Reasons for this Wish are very weighty.&nbsp; For,</p>
<p class="gutindent">I.&nbsp; <i>The Righteous are best prepaid
for death</i>:</p>
<p class="gutindent">and,</p>
<p class="gutindent">II.&nbsp; <i>For what is to follow after
Death</i>.</p>
<p>For, However terrible the apprehensions of it may be to Man,
as naturally as to other Creatures: Yet, He hath cause to be
afraid of it for a<a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>farther reason.&nbsp; For He dieth not as the
Beast.&nbsp; Death is not only a Law of Nature, but <i>it is the
wages of sin</i>.&nbsp; And what we suffer is a part of that
vengeance which is due to transgression, and therefore it is a
passage to a Judgment that cannot be avoided, and to a Life that
shall never end.</p>
<p>Of this Truth there are mighty presumptions: from the great
consent of Nations (who have been far from communicating their
first notions to each other) from the strength of Evidence, which
in Courts of Justice relies on this Belief, from the appeals of
oppress&rsquo;d and injur&rsquo;d Persons to a future Tribunal,
from the stings and remorse of Conscience which they have felt
and confest, who have been guilty of heinous Crimes, and been
above common Justice: and from the exceeding unwillingness to
die, which notorious sinners have exprest, tho in pain and misery
to others intolerable.&nbsp; But since God hath in his holy Word
revealed the cause of our Mortality: and that there is another
Life, and a second Death, as sure as there is <i>a God that
judgeth righteously</i>; so surely is the <i>death of the
Righteous to be wisht</i>, <i>and a latter end like
his</i>.&nbsp; We know, That <i>the grace of God which bringeth
Salvation unto all men</i>, <i>hath appeared in the world
teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts</i>, <i>we
should live soberly</i>, <i>righteously</i>, <i>and godly in this
present world looking for that blessed hope and glorious
appearance </i><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span><i>of the great God</i>, <i>and our Saviour Jesus
Christ</i>.&nbsp; Therefore, since all must appear before his
Judgment Seat, to give an account for what they have done in the
flesh: <i>What is the hope of the hypocrite</i>, and the
unrighteous person, <i>tho he hath gained much</i>, <i>when God
taketh away his Soul</i>?&nbsp; How is he prepared to meet his
God?&nbsp; <i>The sinner being an hundred years old shall be
accursed</i>: Tho he may have sung rest often to his Soul, tho he
may have eat, and drunk and been exceeding merry, yet when
sadness, usual in old age, and the days <i>draw on in which he
finds no pleasure</i>, what comfort can he have, if he look back
on the time he hath past without God in the World, or if he look
forward on an incomprehensible Eternity?&nbsp; All his delights
are vanisht away: All for which he denyed God, in his deeds, hath
forsaken him: and then to mind him of his former joys, is like to
<i>Abraham&rsquo;s</i> telling the Rich Man in Hell, across the
Gulf, <i>Son</i>, <i>Remember that thou in thy life time
receivedst thy good things</i>.&nbsp; This Admonition nearly
resembles one of the Torments of the fallen Spirits, the memory
of whose former Blessed Estate inflames their anguish in the
place of endless Misery.</p>
<p>But if there be no comfort in looking back, there is none for
such a person, when he shall hear the summons, <i>Thou fool</i>,
<i>this night shall thy Soul be required of thee</i>?&nbsp; Then
whose are all those <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>things for which thou didst hazard thy Eternal
Salvation?&nbsp; Then all that the impenitent Soul can wish for,
is, That, (contrary to the misgivings of his Heart, and the Word
of God) he may be blotted out of the Book of Life, and he may
sink into an Abyss of Oblivion.</p>
<p>Who can express the astonishment of a Soul, which being on the
confines of this and another World, hovering on its trembling
lips, not able to stay, and not daring to depart, is yet sure to
perish for ever, if there be a Register in Heaven, if there be a
Resurrection from the Dead, if there be a Heaven and a
Hell?&nbsp; Surely when all the fruits and profits of Sin are
weigh&rsquo;d against this extreme danger, no Christian will
pray, Let me die the death of the wicked.</p>
<p>For, (blessed be God) tho he in the height of Pride, or during
his eager pursuit of Power and Wealth, may never think of his
latter end, or what is to follow it; yet when by God&rsquo;s
Judgments on the Earth, or by his immediate Visitation, he sees
he must die, then without any Hypocrisie, he prays that <i>he may
be numbed with the children of God</i>, <i>and that his lot may
be among the Saints</i>.&nbsp; Some indeed of the Heathens
incourag&rsquo;d themselves in their wicked ways, by hearing that
at their death a few worthy Men among them question&rsquo;d
Providence, and counted Vertue an empty name, because they were
overcome when <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>they fought for a reputed good Cause.&nbsp; What would
the insultings of sensual Men over Religion be, if so many pious
Persons on their death-beds renounc&rsquo;d as heartily their
good Works, and Faith in God, as there have been, and are wicked
Christians, who abhor the remembrance of their past deeds of
darkness? of their rioting and drunkenness, their chambering and
wantonness, their blasphemies, and their enmity to the Cross of
Christ?&nbsp; How would the credulity of godly Men be
laugh&rsquo;d at, if as weighty and unsuspected Witnesses,
deposed at their last gasp against the Belief of the Life to
come, and the Joys of Heaven; as there are undeniable Witnesses
who depose against the Lusts of the Flesh, the Lusts of the Eye,
and the Pride of Life? assuring us that this world&rsquo;s Pomp,
which so soon passeth away is not worth our utmost endeavours:
and that they are truly Wise, who mind the One thing that is
necessary, that which shall never be taken from them?&nbsp; How
often do we hear ungodly Parents, and others, warn in their last
Sicknesses, such as they love, to avoid the reigning sins of the
Age, as the road way to Perdition; and exhort them to follow
Holiness, as they hope ever to see God: For That will only bring
Peace at the last?&nbsp; But they who are Righteous before God,
when the time of their laying aside their Tabernacles draws near,
they repent not of their <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>past Repentance, nor adjure their
Children to abstain from like Faith; neither do they counsel
them, not to forego things present and temporal, for those that
are not seen, for those that are Eternal: But on the contrary,
abounding in hope full of Immortality, they know it is best for
them to be dissolved, and to be with Christ: In those last
moments (so full of horror to others) to the Righteous their
Light increaseth: They have Peace which passeth all
Understanding, and such Joys, as are foretasts of the bliss of
Eternity.&nbsp; For, Who in that extremity can be animated with
so well grounded a Courage, as he who is taught, That being
called by the Grace of God to the Knowledge of his Will; being
confirmed in it by the operations of the Spirit, he is united by
Faith, and participation in his Holy Sacrament, to Christ our
Head, and knows therefore, that through Death his Saviour <i>hath
destroyed him who had the power of death</i>, <i>and
deliver&rsquo;d them</i>, <i>who through fear of death</i>,
<i>were subject to bondage</i>?</p>
<p>What other reasonings of seriousest minds have ever suggested
such consolation as the Scripture hath afforded to thousands, in
all Ages, whose Love stronger than Death, relying on these
precious Promises, hath made them more than Conquerors, through
him that loved them?&nbsp; Are the Arguments drawn from
Philosophy of equal force? or have they had a like blessed
effect?&nbsp; <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>Such as these; That what we suffer is the lot of all
Mankind: That it is a Decree that must be obeyed; it is a debt, a
tribute due to Nature; an Eternal Sleep.&nbsp; That therefore it
is to no purpose to afflict our selves for what cannot be
avoided: That since all things must come to an end, as the
greatest Persons, so the noblest Cities, the best founded
Empires, and even the World it self; therefore Men ought not to
wonder that they are so frail, nor murmur because they are so
Mortal?&nbsp; How weak are these Arguments in respect of such as
we have from Revelation, which sheweth us, That tho for our sins,
and our Forefathers, we are subject to Pain, Misery and
dissolution, yet we are still under the Eye of God, who by
sending his Son <i>to die for our sins</i>, <i>and rise again for
our justification</i>, hath declared, That <i>to them who are in
Christ Jesus</i>, <i>who walk not after the flesh</i>, <i>but
after the spirit</i>, <i>there is no condemnation</i>, <i>and
that nothing shall be able to separate them from the love of God
in Christ Jesus</i>.</p>
<p>What also are the duties wherein a Righteous Man is to
exercise himself, and in doing of which he desires to end his
days?&nbsp; Are they, that are enjoyned by our Holy Faith, such
as he needs to be ashamed of, whoever believeth his Soul is
Immortal, and that he must appear before a God infinitely Just,
Holy and Almighty?&nbsp; Would any Rational Man wish that he may
die, denying <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>the Existence, or the Providence of a Supreme Being:
Blaspheming his Name, or scoffing at his Worship, dishonouring
his own Parents, or murdering his Brethren, defiling their Bed,
or injuring their good Name, or their substance; or will any one
blush, and have his Heart reproach him in his last Sickness, for
not having walkt in Lasciviousness, Lusts, excess of Wine,
Revellings, Banquetings and abominable Idolatries?&nbsp; Will his
Conscience then upbraid him for not having devour&rsquo;d the
Fatherless, and Widows Houses, which then are to be left behind,
to an ungrateful Heir or a stranger? or will he then Pray, May my
Soul be with them who have despised the Preachers of
Righteousness, and who are undone for ever, if there be a Judge
of the Living and the Dead? or rather will any one who is Wise,
when his Eyes are to be closed, when his Breath is departing, and
he must never more see this Light; then be exceeding glad, if
through God&rsquo;s Grace, his past Life hath been a constant
course of Honest dealings towards all Men, (possessing his Vessel
in Sanctification, and his Portion with content) and of acts of
Humanity and Charity to his Brethren, of Reverence to his
Superiors, and unfeigned Devotion to his God?&nbsp; And will he
not then Pray, That he may be found not having his own
Righteousness which is of the Law, but that which is through
Faith of <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>Christ: Having the Saviour of the World to intercede for
him, and to offer up the Merit of his infinitely satisfactory
Death; and so give up the Ghost, crying, Come Lord Jesus, come
quickly?&nbsp; Is not such a Christian best prepar&rsquo;d to
leave this World?&nbsp; Who would not with <i>Balaam</i> wish
this end?&nbsp; <i>Who would not die the death of the
Righteous</i>?</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; <i>For the Righteous are best prepar&rsquo;d for
what is to follow after death</i>.</p>
<p>Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints:
It is but a passage to a far more desirable state.&nbsp; They who
depart hence disappear, but are not lost; They sleep, but are not
dead forever.&nbsp; Their Spirits vanish not into soft Air, but
are committed into his hands, who is able to keep, and will
restore them faithfully to their Bodies at the last day.&nbsp;
Blessed then are they, who having seen an end of their
sufferings, having laid aside their earthly Houses, in which
being burden&rsquo;d they groan&rsquo;d, shall then receive the
end of their Faith, the Salvation of their Souls.&nbsp; Then
they, arriv&rsquo;d in a safe Haven, in a place of Everlasting
Rest, shall with Joy look back on what they have been
deliver&rsquo;d from, and with amazement on what they are
admitted to.&nbsp; They shall bless the God and Father of our
Lord Jesus, for freeing them from the Tribulations and
Persecutions, which they either long endur&rsquo;d, justly
fear&rsquo;d, or from their Heart pitied in their Brethren: <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>then they
shall no more tremble under the Chastisements of a Father, or the
Judgments of an offended God: Then all Tears will be wip&rsquo;d
away, and all possibility of Grief will cease.&nbsp; Then they
shall no more labour under the burden of Years, or more grievous
weight of Sins: They shall not cry out, <i>Wo is me</i>, <i>that
my soul hath long dwelt with them that hate peace</i>.&nbsp; Or,
<i>O wretched man that I am</i>, <i>who shall deliver me from the
body of this death</i>?&nbsp; But then they shall see that their
light Afflictions which were but for a moment, shall work for
them, <i>a far more exceeding</i>, <i>eternal weight of
glory</i>: When the Sun of Righteousness shining on them, shall
make them shine as Suns in the Kingdom: When they shall always be
with Christ, and not see darkly as in a Glass, but face to face
see God as he is, who then will be all in all.</p>
<p>For the accomplishment of this hope, the Righteous wait,
looking into the Grave without astonishment, as seeing beyond
that Gulf, the place where Mortality shall be swallowed up of
Life: And therefore when others tremble hearing of the Worm that
shall never die, the Fire that never shall be extinguisht, and
the dying that shall never end, the true Disciples of our Lord
incourage themselves with the assurance of their going into their
Countrey above, and entring into a Building, not made with hands,
everlasting in the Heavens: That they shall be admitted into
Paradise, where no tempter shall come, no Sin <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>shall
endanger their Blessedness; but they shall be with Christ, that
they may behold and enjoy the Glory to which God hath exalted
him.&nbsp; In this perswasion the Primitive Christians used at
the Funerals of Martyrs and Confessors, with great joy to sing
Psalms and Hymns of Thanksgiving, thereby shewing that they
firmly believed that those Servants of Christ had received the
Reward of their Sufferings: They carried also Lights burning
before their Corps, as before Conquerors, blessing God for
crowning departed Saints with rays of the same Glory wherein
their Redeemer shin&rsquo;d; and hoping that following the same
steps, they should partake of the same Happiness.</p>
<p>But it is not only the blessed state of the Souls of the
Righteous which makes their latter end to be desirable; but that
also of their Bodies: They, tho committed to the Earth, tho laid
in the Dust, rest in Hope: They do but wait for the sound of the
Trumpet of the Archangel of God; and then they shall be raised
never more to see Corruption; when the hour shall come, in which
the Grave shall give up its Dead, and the Sea shall very
faithfully give up its Dead.</p>
<p>As certain as Christ our first-fruits is risen, as He the
First-born from the Dead, (however once despised, crucified,
committed to the Sepulchre) in his Humanity is at the Right Hand
of the Father, so certain will be the Resurrection of all
Mankind: The hour is coming in which all that are in their <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>Graves, shall
hear his voice, and shall come forth: <i>They that have done evil
to the Resurrection of Damnation</i>, <i>and they that have done
well to the Resurrection of Life</i>.&nbsp; This is the blessed
conclusion of their Days, who for the Merits of their Saviour are
accepted as Righteous before God: This Death is surely to be
desired, and everyone from his heart may pray, <i>May my latter
end be like his</i>.</p>
<p>But if we would not have this prove a meer fruitless Wish, as
it was to <i>Balaam</i>; if we would not have our desire, like
that of the sluggards, kill us; whoever long for the death of the
Righteous, must live his Life.&nbsp; You have heard that his
diseases, or griefs, or agonies in departure, are not usually
less, or easier, than those of other Men: But his Peace of Mind,
his Joy in Conscience, his resignation to God&rsquo;s Will, and
above all, his Faith in the blessed Jesus, (that by it being
justified, he shall also be glorified) These make his latter end
desirable.&nbsp; Imitate we then their Conversation, whose Death
we covet; exercise we our selves to have a Conscience void of
Offence towards God, and towards Man; mortifying our Corruptions,
and dying to the World before we leave it: And then when our race
is finish&rsquo;d, when we have fought the good fight, doubt we
not but the righteous Judge will <i>give us the crown of
life</i>, <i>which he hath prepar&rsquo;d for all that love his
appearance</i>.</p>
<p>In Belief that this Honourable Person liv&rsquo;d the Life,
and died the Death of the Righteous, we pay <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>this respect,
and give this Testimony to her Pious Memory: <i>Mourning as they
who have hope</i>, and assur&rsquo;d that such as <i>sleep in the
Lord</i> shall <i>be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints
in Light</i>.&nbsp; For such our charitable Hope, we have here
very Christian grounds, and would to God, That for all to whom we
perform the like last Offices, we had the like comfortable
Prospect.&nbsp; Give me leave, for the glory of God&rsquo;s
Grace, and the Edification (as it is design&rsquo;d) of such as
hear, especially of the same Sex, to give some short account why
she may justly be proposed for an example, and the conclusion of
her days be wish&rsquo;d for.&nbsp; As the outward advantages
which this Noble Lady enjoy&rsquo;d, were visibly eminent, and in
the eye of the World valuable, as Birth, Youth, Beauty and
Honourable Relation: So the endowments of her Soul are
represented as far more to be esteem&rsquo;d, and accordingly
would have shin&rsquo;d forth if her modesty had not veil&rsquo;d
them.&nbsp; They who knew her from her infancy, assure us, that
she had the early blessing of a Religious Education: That she
could not remember the time that she began to serve, to pray to,
and to praise God; That betimes there appear&rsquo;d signs of a
sanctified Nature in her younger behaviour: That she
<i>remember&rsquo;d her Creator in the days of her youth</i>, and
even then <i>laid a foundation for the life to come</i>: That a
more beautiful mind shewing it self adorn&rsquo;d with all the
Vertues of her Sex, added still Lustre to outward <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>comeliness;
and growing in stature she grew in favour with God and her
Parents.&nbsp; That, that fair Morning was overcast with no
Clouds, no Tears were shed for any unhappy blemishes of heedless
Youth.&nbsp; That the more she experienc&rsquo;d and tasted in
her Soul how good the ways of God were, and what peace of
Conscience and serenity of Mind, arose from them, the more she
delighted in God, and in Religious Duties: That this her practice
of True Piety influenc&rsquo;d all her Words and Conversation: So
that as the Vertuous Woman, <i>She opened her mouth with
wisdom</i>, <i>and in her tongue was the law of kindness</i>.</p>
<p>The Rules of her Life, which she had written, and I have read,
were confirm&rsquo;d and approv&rsquo;d by her constant
observance of them: In them how truly a Christian course did she
prescribe to her self?&nbsp; How truly to be recommended from
this place?&nbsp; Enjoyning her self to be sure to begin the day
with the praises of God for his preservation of her in the night;
and with earnest Prayers to be kept in his Fear, and under his
Protection all that Day: To read the <i>Psalms</i> and portions
of Scripture appointed for the Day; by which she might be made
wise to Eternal Salvation: To meditate on it, in order to improve
in godliness and all respective duties to her Maker, and all
others: Then not to suffer the remaining hours to be wasted in
vain amusements, or over-curious dressing; but setting to such
Work <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>as
became her Sex, and was useful in her condition: <i>So her
works</i> (as the wise Womans) <i>praised her</i>, <i>and the
ways of her houshold they commended her</i>.&nbsp; And having
past the Morning in vertuous Employment; at a set time in the
Afternoon she retired to Prayer, and Reading, and Meditating: And
in the Evening, surveyed her Actions, and examin&rsquo;d them, as
strictly as any domestick accounts: Then offer&rsquo;d her
Evening Sacrifice of Praise for the Mercies of the day past, and
by Prayer recommended her Body, Soul, and Spirit to the same God,
for the safety and refreshments of the night, and lay down to
sleep, as one who might wake in Eternity.</p>
<p>Moreover, what was practised in secret, and in the closet,
broke forth and manifested it self in the publick Service of
God.&nbsp; For how remarkable was her very reverend deportment in
his House?&nbsp; How full of awe meet for the place of his more
special Presence, and the celebration of his most Holy Mysteries
and Sacraments? no straying looks, no contrivances for utmost
ease, no sign of thoughts wandring far from his Service: But a
seriousness sutable to the gravest of years, and a devotion as
might have become her, if she had known how soon she was to
appear in Spirit before the Living God.</p>
<p>Such exemplariness in all Vertue and Piety, as it
appear&rsquo;d betimes, so it ended not but with her last.&nbsp;
What was so laudably begun, was steadily and happily prosecuted;
insomuch, That if we <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>reckon her stay on Earth by her
proficiency in what was worthy of Praise and of good report we
shall scarce believe that her course was finisht at Eighteen: In
years so subject to frailty, wilfulness and folly; and in an age
so addicted to Pride, excess of Vanity, and indifference for
Religion.</p>
<p>But here we may be ready to expostulate, Why was so excellent
a Christian so soon, why so suddenly snatcht away?&nbsp; Why only
shew&rsquo;d, and begun to be known here, and then hastily
remov&rsquo;d?&nbsp; Altho it be sufficient in general, to
answer, It is the Lord&rsquo;s doing, and therefore it is as it
ought to be: Yet hath God in his Word revealed very satisfactory
reasons for such his dealings: He hath let us know that the
Righteous are often <i>taken away</i>, (not in wrath, but in
mercy) <i>from the evil to come</i>: That they are recalled from
a place of danger; That they are thereby secured from any hazard
of their future Blessedness: Above all we are sure that no
departed Soul will complain of being too soon removed hence into
Heaven.&nbsp; That <i>Abel</i> the first of <i>Adam&rsquo;s</i>
Sons who pleased God, died by a hidden stroke, tho the youngest:
and that that Patriarch who walkt with God was translated hence,
before he had seen half the days of some of them who lived before
the Flood: And that the Son of <i>Jeroboam</i>, <i>Abijah</i>,
died a Child, because in him was found some good toward the Lord
God of <i>Israel</i>.&nbsp; Therefore the Righteous are never
prevented with Death, for they are in rest.&nbsp; <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>For,
Honourable Age is not that which standeth in length of time, nor
that is measur&rsquo;d by number of years, but Wisdom is the grey
head, and an unspotted Life is old Age.&nbsp; So that in this
occasion may we not apply what is said of <i>Enoch</i>?&nbsp; She
pleased God, and was beloved of him, so that living among sinners
she was translated: yea speedily was she taken away, lest that
Wickedness should alter her Understanding, or deceit beguile her
Soul.&nbsp; Therefore being soon consummated, she fulfilled a
long time; and Youth being soon perfected, riseth up in judgment
against the many years and old Age of the Unrighteous.&nbsp;
Whoever then have lived so well, may be reputed old; since they
have lived to a blessed purpose: If many of 70, or 80 years, are
to count no more of their time, than what they have spent
according to their Duty, they will prove much younger than this
Pious Person; many grey heads will be <i>found Infants of
days</i>.&nbsp; Therefore this deceased Christian having answered
the end for which God sent her into the World, having been
faithful in the talent of Time, however little, that was intruded
with her; she is as truly Blessed, as any devout Woman, who may
have waited longest in the Temple of God, <i>for the redemption
of Israel</i>: For, surely those Persons die not untimely who
expire into Happiness, and they have lived to the truest Old Age,
who live with God to all Eternity.</p>
<p>Neither will the suddenness her death (by <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>Convulsions
which seized her Intellectuals and Vitals at once) cause her
latter end not to be wisht for.</p>
<p>Indeed in the Litany of our Church we pray against sudden
death; not that the Salvation of all who so die, is therefore
questionable; but because such a Death is too often liable to
rash and uncharitable censures: and because a leasurable
dissolution affords time to perfect Repentance, to pass an
uncorrupt Judgment on the pleasures of Sin and the Vanities of
the World; and by disingaging the Soul from sensible Objects,
dissposeth it for entrance into a Blessed Eternity.&nbsp;
However, They who order their Conversation every day as if it
were their last, are never surprised; their future condition is
not doubtful.&nbsp; Quick riddance out of Life may be requested
by such Christians, and be bestowed on them as a benefit.</p>
<p>Since then the sentence was to be underwent, the speedy
execution of it was desirable, in behalf of a person provided
against it; and it may be reputed a favour that she was hastily
taken away.&nbsp; Thereby she was excused from the apprehensions
which fore-run Death, and make it more dreadful; she
indur&rsquo;d not the languishings, their irksom Days, and worse
Nights, that by slow degrees wast such as are Consumptive: nor
did she tremble at the violent assaults, and racking Torments of
tedious, often returning Diseases.&nbsp; She was spar&rsquo;d the
grief, which would have pierc&rsquo;d her Soul, of beholding the
tears, the unfeigned sorrow, and distraction, <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>of an
afflicted, disconsolate Father, for his beloved, for his only
Child, in that very moment wherein he expected the happy increase
of his Posterity.&nbsp; And more especially, in parting from her
Noble Lord, she was excused Agonies, which only could exceed
those which she lately felt, (which were almost mortal) when he
for a few months was obliged to leave her.</p>
<p>But hereby how doth God warn all, Young no less than aged
Christians, what a necessity there is of a daily watchfulness,
and how blessed it is to be constantly serious and devout?&nbsp;
What a condition are they in, who by a like stroke are hurried
away in the prime of their strength, and the heighth of their
sins?&nbsp; What had the danger of her Eternal Salvation been, if
at that time, in that extremity, she had been to begin to call
upon God, and to learn the practice of her Duty to him, just when
she was summon&rsquo;d to appear before his judgment Seat?&nbsp;
How happy was it for her, That the <i>Lord came at an hour</i>,
<i>that he was not lookt for</i>; she was found <i>as a good and
faithful servant</i>: and therefore might look to <i>enter into
the joy of her Master</i>.&nbsp; To her then, <i>to live was
Christ</i>, <i>and to die gain</i>.</p>
<p>But the loss is to the survivors; great cause had a Father to
desire that such a Child should live to be a comfort to his Age,
and pay her last duty to his Memory: He knew her worth, and he
blest God for her; and hath as just cause, as ever any Parent
had, to lament her Death: and yet he declares <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>that if he
might by his wish, he would not for his own advantage, do her the
wrong to recal her into Life, causing her to leave that place of
happiness into which he firmly believes her Spirit is
receiv&rsquo;d.&nbsp; And as her Noble Lord still increas&rsquo;d
his esteem and Love, the more he observ&rsquo;d her discreet,
Vertuous and Pious Deportment: So in that her surprising danger,
he shew&rsquo;d an unfeign&rsquo;d concern; nothing was
spar&rsquo;d, no cost, no assistance that might relieve her
Pains, or retrieve her Health.&nbsp; And when the last moments,
when the appointed Change came, that undaunted, that approved
Valour was overcome; he abandon&rsquo;d himself to Grief, and
confest that in this appearance Death was, even to him, exceeding
terrible: And, as her concern for his Honour surmounted her
Affection, and restrain&rsquo;d her from desiring his stay at
home last Summer, when his duty called him to the War abroad: So,
his unquestionable Resolution was not able to hold in his Tears
for this Loss, and to suppress any of the violences of Grief, by
which in his Death she would have been transported.</p>
<p>Neither may only such as are Relations be concern&rsquo;d in
so mournful an occasion: Humanity may engage us to lament so
great worth in the flower of Youth taken away, without any Branch
or off-set left: and Christianity may teach us to bewail the
removal of a Light that began to shine so brightly in the midst
of us, promising to be an ornament and blessing to the
place.&nbsp; But, as <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>to her self, (if the Spirits of the
Just departed hence, are allowed to know what is done here on
earth, and were permitted to speak to their surviving friends)
she would intreat them to moderate their Lamentations: shewing
their respects to the deceased, by honouring her in the imitation
of what is well pleasing to God, and tends to his Glory and their
own Salvation.&nbsp; And therefore whoever of the same Sex, value
her character, and desire the same in the like occasion, may they
let their adorning be, not the outward one <i>of plaiting the
hair</i>, <i>and of wearing of gold</i>, <i>and putting on of
apparel</i>, <i>but let it be the hidden man of the heart</i>,
<i>the ornament of a quiet and meek spirit</i>.&nbsp; An
abstinence from all appearance of Evil, a jealousie over all
their behaviour, and the beauty of holiness.&nbsp; These Graces
will be always of great price, (tho Favour be deceitful,
Comeliness soon blasted, and Portions flown away) They who abound
in these, will be dear to their Parents, beloved by their
Husbands, respected by all that value Goodness, blest in the
Children, lamented in their Deaths, and above all, together with
the Saints, heirs of the Grace of Life Eternal.</p>
<p>Wherefore since we know that all things come to an end, and
that the time of our departure may be near, it concerns all who
have daily intimations of their Mortality, to consider what will
stand them in stead after a very transitory Life: And therefore
to <i>work out their salvation with fear </i><a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span><i>and
trembling</i>, whilst it is called to day; while they have the
Light.&nbsp; For there is <i>no device</i>, <i>nor knowledge</i>,
<i>nor work</i>, <i>nor wisdom in the grave</i>, <i>whither we
all go</i>.&nbsp; They then will be found wise, who have lived,
as if they designed chiefly to save their Souls; <i>setting their
affections on things above</i>, and not on a world whose
<i>fashion so soon passeth away</i>: and who, as this Religious
Person, <i>are rich in Faith</i>, <i>and full of good works</i>,
which will accompany them beyond the Grave.</p>
<p>If we make this good use of the constant admonitions which are
given to us, who are yet in the land of the Living, or rather in
the land of the Dying: If we bless him for the examples of such
as have been Lights in the midst of perverse generations: If we
chiefly bless him, for begetting <i>us to a lively hope of an
inheritance incorruptible reserved in the Heavens</i>, <i>through
the Resurrection of Jesus from the dead</i>.&nbsp; Then <i>shall
we live</i>, Then <i>shall we also die</i>, <i>unto the Lord</i>;
and as sure <i>as Jesus died</i>, <i>and rose again</i>, <i>even
so them that sleep with Jesus will God bring with him</i>;
<i>when the Spirits of just men shall be made perfect</i>, <i>and
when with the General Assembly</i>, <i>and Church of the
First-born</i>, in Heaven, they stall ascribe to Father, Son and
Holy Ghost, all Honour, and Glory, and Salvation, for ever.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
